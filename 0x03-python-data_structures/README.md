Here's a comprehensive overview of data structures in Python:

Built-in Data Structures:

Lists:
Ordered, mutable collections of items.
Allow duplicates.
Accessed by index (starting from 0).
Efficient for sequential access and element modification.
Example: numbers = [1, 4, 2, 5]
Tuples:
Ordered, immutable collections of items.
Allow duplicates.
Accessed by index.
Useful for representing fixed data structures.
Example: coordinates = (3, 5)
Dictionaries:
Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Mutable.
Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
Used for fast lookups by key.
Example: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
Sets:
Unordered collections of unique elements.
Mutable.
Efficient for membership testing and duplicate removal.
Example: unique_letters = {"a", "b", "c"}
User-Defined Data Structures:

Stacks:
LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure.
Used for undo/redo operations, backtracking, function calls.
Implemented using lists or classes.
Queues:
FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure.
Used for task scheduling, buffering data.
Implemented using collections.deque or classes.
Trees:
Hierarchical data structure with nodes and edges.
Used for representing file systems, decision trees, sorting algorithms.
Binary trees, binary search trees, heaps are common types.
Graphs:
Network of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
Used for modeling relationships, maps, social networks.
Choosing the Right Data Structure:

Consider the following factors:
Nature of the data (ordered, unordered, key-value, etc.)
Operations needed (access, insertion, deletion, searching, sorting)
Efficiency requirements (time and space complexity)
